(71, 'Companies like Coinbase are rescinding tech grads job offers', 'Tech was in a hiring frenzy, an\'d Loom was fresh off a massive $130 million Series C funding round backed by impressive venture-capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz. Its head count had more than doubled in the past two years as it joined firms like Amazon, Google, and Zoom in riding high amid a pandemic boom', '                   Just a few months later, the other shoe dropped. Valuations and market caps were slashed in half, pushing high-flying startups and public tech giants to tighten their belts. Now, just two weeks ahead of his start date, Chan told Insider he received a \"surprising and devastating\" phone call from his recruiter. Because of \"unforeseen economic circumstances,\" his offer was being rescinded.\r\n\r\nWhile some firms have conducted layoffs in the downturn, others have made the rarer move of rescinding job offers en masse just weeks, or in some cases days, before new employees\' start dates. And one group has been uniquely caught in the middle: tech newcomers such as interns and fresh-faced college graduates who had their first-ever jobs taken away before they even began.\r\n\r\nTwitter, for example, recently rescinded offers extended to candidates, pointing to larger turmoil after Elon Musk announced he was buying the company. Coinbase, which planned just a year ago to more than triple its head count, rescinded over 300 offers — a large portion of them new-grad engineers. Once hot startups like Redfin and Loom, which raised millions in funding last year, also laid off employees and cut many new grads loose in attempt to cut costs. \r\n\r\n\"I got the call, and I immediately started bawling my eyes out,\" a new grad who was set to start full time with a popular e-commerce startup after interning with the firm in 2021 told Insider.\r\n\r\nThe former intern, who asked to remain anonymous to protect future job prospects, was just three weeks out from graduation when he learned the opportunity he had worked for and planned his future around was gone. \r\n\r\n\"It was really scary — I had just been there a week ago, visiting the office and getting shown around. And I found out a week later that a lot of my colleagues knew that it was probably going to happen, but they weren\'t sure if they were allowed to tell me,\" he said. \r\n\r\nThrongs of devastated new grads and interns who thought their job plans were secure have taken to LinkedIn and Twitter to share how they\'ve been scrambling. Many describe how they turned down other lucrative opportunities or were in the process of moving across the country for jobs they no longer have, while others who were counting on the job for visas are now in a particularly tight spot.\r\n\r\n\"People have been really supportive. But it\'s my finals week, so I\'d have to job hunt while also balancing schoolwork,\" Chan said, adding that despite recruiters and other engineers helping him land interviews, he\'d decided he\'s done with the job-hunting process and would instead take up an old job.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s just too tiring to deal with anymore,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNew grads are frustrated, saying tech companies mishandled communication and left them in the dark \r\nWhile many new grads who Insider spoke with said they understood cost cutting was a necessary part of the industry, they were frustrated with how tech companies mishandled communication. \r\n\r\nFor example, the new grad who was set to join the e-commerce startup said communications from management seemed \"like the company was moving in a positive direction.\" But once the firm suddenly started laying off employees, he said he was met with two weeks of radio silence and \"nonanswers\" before human resources called him saying that his return offer had been rescinded. \r\n\r\n\"I am someone who really likes certainty, and suddenly everything was in jeopardy. So I went into panic mode,\" the former intern told Insider. \"I was moving to New York in a few weeks because of this job, and I suddenly found out that I\'m about to move to New York unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nFor many international students, these last-minute changes are not just questions of their careers or livelihood — their visa status is dependent on securing a job in their field of study. \r\n\r\nAshutosh Ukey, a 23-year-old who recently received his master\'s from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told Insider he turned down multiple Ph.D. offers to work for Coinbase. His was one of many offers rescinded by the crypto company shortly before his start date, and now with just five months left before his visa expires, he needs to land a new job quickly or will be forced to leave the country.\r\n\r\n\"For programmers who need visa sponsorship, there\'s a lot more on the line,\" he said. \"It\'s not just a financial or career setback; it\'s a question of whether you can even stay in the country. There\'s a lot more pressure to try to find a new role in time.\"\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Coinbase had promised new hires their jobs were safe just two weeks earlier, saying via email that the firm was \"extremely excited\" to have them join and would not be rescinding any job offers. So it was a shock when over 300 Coinbase new hires later received a mass email saying that because of \"rapidly changing market conditions,\" the firm was rescinding their job offers.\r\n\r\n\"I was hearing all this news that crypto was crashing,\" another new grad who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn\'t authorized to speak with the press told Insider. \"But I got an email with Coinbase telling me to not worry and that everything was fine. Then literally, shortly after my birthday, I get an email saying my offer was rescinded. I made a lot of plans that are in ruins now.\" \r\n\r\nNew engineers say that rescinded offers are wearing down their faith in the tech industry\r\nEspecially in a time when tech is battling both a downturn and a talent shortage, some prospective engineers have lost trust in the companies that have pulled the rug out from under them.\r\n\r\nHungry to recruit new talent, many companies wooed new grads with lucrative packages. One new grad who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn\'t authorized to speak with the press said he turned down offers from Meta, Amazon, Tesla, and TikTok to work for Coinbase, which offered him $188,000 and, more importantly, the option to work from wherever he wanted as an entry-level engineer.\r\n\r\nHis offer was also rescinded just as he was about to graduate. And while Meta and Tesla were aggressively hiring in the beginning of the year, both companies had shut their doors — pausing hiring indefinitely — when he tried to get back his offers.\r\n\r\n\"I was getting interviews from TikTok, Tesla, Amazon back in December,\" the new grad told Insider. \"But now job hunting is lot harder. Everything\'s died down. There\'s a lot less job listings and less recruiters.\" \r\n\r\nMany new grads and interns Insider spoke with said this recent episode in tech\'s seemingly indefinite downturn had shaken their faith in the industry. Landing that first job as an entry-level engineer requires months of work — studying questions, juggling multiple recruiter calls, poring over LeetCode to nail the notoriously intimidating technical interviews.\r\n\r\n\"This experience taught me that you are never guaranteed a job,\" the new grad who had his offer rescinded by the e-commerce company where he interned told Insider. \"A contract means nothing because companies are more than happy to drop you in a heartbeat if it means they have to do it for the company.\" \r\n\r\nFor some new grads, this is valuable time they cannot afford to spend. Ukey said that he used to be excited about exploring experimental and innovative areas in tech, like crypto and blockchain. But while many crypto startups have tried to recruit him since Coinbase rescinded his offer, he\'s decided that crypto isn\'t a risk he can take — at least not for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nWhile rescinded job offers are not a widespread cost-cutting practice, new-grad roles are vulnerable when a company tightens its belt, Jay Denton, the chief analyst at the compensation-data firm LaborIQ, said. \r\n\r\n\"When a company is growing a lot, they hire a lot of new grads because instead of getting someone with four to six years of experience, they can hire new grads who cost 15 to 20% less,\" Denton told Insider. \"Yet when it comes to cost cutting, if you look at today\'s market rate, there\'s almost a 10% gap between today and last year\'s market-rate pay for engineers. So instead of hiring someone brand new at market rate, many companies are choosing to focus on retaining old hires if they could.\" \r\n\r\nIn addition to employee trust, the mass of rescinded offers might also shape company loyalty for the new class of tech professionals just entering the workforce. Employee loyalty had already declined during the \"Great Resignation,\" when employees had more leverage, and now the increasingly turbulent job landscape has the potential to chip away at that even further.\r\n\r\n\"I used to be really excited, but now I realized I can\'t make work my entire personality,\" one new grad told Insider. \"It has definitely made me a lot less loyal.\"     ', 'blog_02.jpg', '', 'blog', '2022-06-18 14:09:08'),

Our product is already generating around $200,000/year right off the bat. Our customers are mainly U.S.-based, and we don’t plan to raise any capital from investors.\r\n\r\nI’ve been looking into the new startup visa option and the E-2 and L-1B visas, and I’ve been pretty heads-down focused on building the product, so I’m not famous.\r\n\r\nWhat’s my best option for bootstrapping my startup in the U.S.?\r\n\r\n— Game-Changing in Germany\r\n\r\nFearless Fund’s Arian Simone on why a downturn is business as usual for minority foundersFearless Fund founder Arian Simone\r\nImage Credits: Fearless Fund\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., Black women are the most entrepreneurial demographic, but they’re also more likely to fall into a funding gap when they need access to capital.\r\n\r\nOut of $330 billion in VC funding that startups received last year, “less than five Black women raised money past the Series A stage, and one of them was Rihanna,” reports Dominic-Madori Davis.\r\n\r\nTo help level the playing field for minority women working in tech and consumer packaged goods, entrepreneur Arian Simone co-founded Fearless Fund in 2019 with business advisor Ayana Parsons and actress Keshia Knight Pulliam.\r\n\r\nThe fund has backed 31 companies to date, and despite the chill in the markets, it has no plans to slow down.\r\n\r\n“Companies that are venture-backed have seen their fair share of horror stories,” said Simone. “They don’t typically get rattled by the current macroeconomic climate.”\r\n\r\nIs consolidation on the horizon for Southeast Asia’s tech industry?\r\nThe super app business model is paying dividends in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nOfferings from Grab, “the everyday everything app,” run the gamut from grocery delivery to investment services; Malaysia-based AirAsia has rebranded itself as Capital A as it expands its offerings to encompass ride hailing, food delivery, and much more.\r\n\r\nThese companies aren’t building these new business units from scratch: they’re using strategic acquisitions to enter new markets and fence out the competition.\r\n\r\n“As more tech companies look to the super app business model to retain users and increase monetization, we could expect more inorganic expansion and consolidation in the coming years,” says Amit Anand, founding partner of Jungle Ventures.\r\n\r\nPitch Deck Teardown: Ergeon’s $40M Series B deck\r\nNeed a new fence or driveway?

(73, 'Fun Fake Generators: Putting Content Into Different Formats', 'There are a number of free generators out there on the web that allow you to place content into different formats that may be more appealing, interesting, or challenging than the usual activity or standard letter-sized handout.', 'share today can be used to generate a newspaper clipping, text message conversation, and Facebook wall.\r\n\r\nFodey.com\r\n\r\nFodey.com is a free site where you can generate a number of things, including newspaper clippings. Your text is limited in length, but it is easy to customize the name of the paper, date, headline, and story. Once generated, you can download an image to post to your LMS, include on a handout, or share with students another way.\r\n\r\nUse content you create for reading activities or discussions. This is especially handy when working with lower level students where you may want to use authentic materials, but have a difficult time finding materials at the appropriate level. You can even turn to your local paper for inspiration and rewrite stories at a suitable level for your students. With higher level students, use authentic materials from a local paper to introduce a specific type of piece—for example, a letter to the editor—and then share the site with students for writing practice and ask them to generate similar pieces or short stories of their own. Just make sure it is newsworthy!\r\n\r\nifaketext.com\r\n\r\nAnother free generator is ifaketext.com, which generates screenshots of text message conversations. Just enter a name, carrier, and conversation to get a perfect screenshot. Use these to discuss the difference between formal and informal writing styles, common text messaging abbreviations (lol, brb, ttyl), and much more.\r\n\r\nStudents can also generate these easily for a short writing assignment. Ask students to create a conversation between two characters in a book they are reading for class, a popular movie, historical figures, or family members. They could turn out to be thoughtful, funny, or informative depending on the assignment and, of course, your students. It is so simple to use, that you may as well try it out to see how it goes.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Machine\r\n\r\nFinally, The Wall Machine allows users to create fake Facebook walls, complete with posts, photos, relationship status and friendship updates, likes, and events. This site is also free and allows you to customize just about everything you can alter on a real Facebook wall. Like the newspaper and text message generators, there is a lot of potential for generating materials yourself to use with students and for students to create new things of their own.\r\n\r\nDepending on your class size, you could have a student or pair of students create a fake Facebook wall for each character in a book at the end of a unit on a particular book. Students would really have to consider their choices carefully and connect with their characters, but could have fun with it too.\r\n\r\nAlthough certainly not revolutionary, these and similar sites put a fun modern twist on reading and writing activities, which can draw students in and engage them more fully than items presented in a way they cannot relate to as easily. If these do not work for your purposes, try another generator, for example this funny newspaper generator, but if you find a better one, let us know by leaving a comment below. Also share with us if you’ve found a different way to use these sites with your students!\r\n\r\nShare:\r\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\r\nAbout Tara Arntsen\r\nTara ArntsenTara Arntsen recently completed her Master\'s degree in Teaching-TESOL at the University of Southern California.

(75, 'Complete Guide to Personalization in Sales Outreach Emails', 'Personalizing the emails for prospects and clients can get you the results you want from your email marketing strategy. As a result, you can engage prospects and drive them toward action, leading to a successful lead prospecting strategy in your sales outreach emails. ', 'Although you cannot personalize every email with great accuracy, you can add a few elements that are enough to spark interest.  \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nTo get you in the right direction, here is the complete guide to email personalization for sales outreach emails that would help you drive your sales and enhance overall lead generation efforts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nFocus on a mutual connection\r\n‍\r\n\r\nResearch conducted by Epsilon shows that 80 percent of clients prefer to buy when provided with a tailored experience.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nEmails go unnoticed because of the big disconnect between prospective customers and the company. However, you can bridge this gap by engaging in shared connections.It is one of the sources for building trust and word-of-mouth promotion.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nMoreover, strategizing your outreach campaign around common ideas and problems is a perfect way to build meaningful relationships with prospects. With the help of a shared connection, you do not remain a stranger to them, and your email doesn’t look unknown anymore.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nMost importantly, it is psychologically proven because your prospect trusts you better, as they can easily relate to you, making them more likely to respond.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nBut how can you find a mutual connection? \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can do so by leveraging social media as per your needs. \r\nYou can search for your prospects’ profiles to help you find a shared connection to mention in your emails. For example, common profiles you find inspirational on LinkedIn and Instagram.\r\nTalk about how your product or service can affect their hobbies and interests.\r\nReach out to influencers in your niche and use their audience as leads.\r\n \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nPersonalizing based on your  prospect’s current technology\r\n‍\r\n\r\nKnowing your prospects’ technological needs would greatly help you cater to the needs of your target email segments. You can ask them about these directly or go deeper into what email platform, tools, or messaging apps they use at the moment.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nThis technique is especially used by SaaS platforms providing downloadable services.For example, software download sites verify the operating system model and provide the software accordingly. \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can use tools such as Builtwith and Datanyze that help you crawl an entire website’s tech stack and list all the platforms and software used on their site. It will give you a complete idea of their current priorities and requirements.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nMoreover, you can also find out if they use the tools of competitors and leverage this data to give your prospectives a better deal.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIt will further help you identify the functions and processes that could provide a possible solution. So, all you need to do is personalize your emails around those pain points and position your services as the perfect solution they need.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompliment your prospectives\r\n‍\r\n\r\nGiving compliments is a sure-shot way to build a close relationship with your prospects. Physiological studies have proved that a meaningful compliment can trigger a similar reaction to receiving money in the recipient’s brain.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nReading an email that offers praise may push the reader to like you, and that’s how you can get them on the path to taking an interest in your services.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can check out the following examples of how to go about being genuine with complements and keeping within a professional context:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nSeminars and blogs\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIf your prospectives gave a presentation in a seminar or published an article that you found interesting, then make sure you let them know what you liked.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nAwards\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIf your prospects have achieved any recognition in their field, you can use that in your email.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nLeader in their field\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIf your potential clients are leaders in their fields, express your admiration for them in your email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nPersonalize around prospects’ interests\r\n‍\r\n\r\nBut how can you know what your clients’ interests are? Leverage the power of social media, where you can find crucial information about their interests and preferences. Browse through their social media profiles to help you understand.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nFurthermore, look for their recent activities by finding their comments, posts, and mentions, which can help you determine what your prospects like and dislike. It would help you in finding shared connections.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nAs per SmarterHQ research, 72% of customers prefer those marketing messages tailored to their specific interests.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nAlthough it’s apparent that data-driven personalization is pertinent for marketers, 63% of them consider it the most challenging strategy to execute. However, it is best to make an outstanding first impression and build a trustworthy relationship with your prospects via email.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHyper-personalize your emails\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can not use hyper-personalized emails  on a larger scale of cold email outreach. Email personalization  needs enormous preparation and qualified research to ensure that you tailor your message with great accuracy and make it relatable to a particular prospect.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would make sense to do a personalized video or email  with top-tier prospects with high-value offers, which contribute a chunk of percentage to your total revenue.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nGive considerable time to think about why you should reach out to them and give a brief about their goals, company size, the prospect’s role, the latest organizational developments, etc.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nMoreover, comprehensively explain how your product can solve their existing problems with proper proofs, case studies, and insights to establish your firm’s credibility.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAvoid spammy content\r\n‍\r\n\r\nImagine how you would feel when you open an email with the subject line, “Guess what we have in store for you!” from an unknown sender? Not a good impression, right?\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nThe power words you used in your subject lines with the wrong context could land your email in spam. Moreover, getting rid of spammy content in your email does not only include subject lines. It also means avoiding these:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nPictures that are of bad quality or irrelevant to the content. Gifs and images can add character to your mail when used right.\r\nHyperlinks already look suspicious to a receiver. But one way to use them is by mentioning exactly where the link will lead the user.\r\nExclamation points!!! They can make your email look unprofessional. Even when using exclamation marks, try not to use multiple signs at once.\r\nAll caps like HELLO DAVID. In the internet language, capital letters are used to represent shouting. They give spammy vibes, and very few people will open the mail when used in the subject line.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVerify your services on the email\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIt is crucial in your email campaign to clean and verify your email list. Otherwise, it might damage your email sender’s reputation, creating bigger problems in the long run because the impression is the only thing that matters.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can easily integrate email cleaning and verification tools into your cold emailing process. Following are the ways you can do the same:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nVerifying emails at the point of entry, when someone submits their email id to your website. You can do a double verification to make sure the details given by the user are correct, and they want your services.\r\nSyncing email cleaning with your CRM platforms and marketing automation tools.\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIt will tremendously improve the accuracy of personalization in your email campaigns.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nCreate meaningful CTAs\r\n‍\r\n\r\nMaybe your end goal is to book a meeting or drive the prospect to buy the product or service of your company. Instead of asking for the same, consider substituting it for a meaningful Call to Action that could pique your prospect’s interest. It might include:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nRegister for a relevant webinar.\r\nDownload a persona-based piece of content like an ebook, blog post, or podcast episode.\r\nVisit a landing page on your company’s website.\r\n‍\r\n\r\nTo make your emails more impactful, use interactive elements inside your email instead of static button CTAs. \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nInstead of a link, add a form that lets your prospect register for the webinar. Or, if it’s a demo meeting you’re trying to book, add a calendar widget. Your prospects will appreciate the reduced number of steps as they can complete the action inside the email itself. \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nWith a no-code tool like Mailmodo, non-tech professionals in sales and marketing can also build interactive emails using a simple drag-and-drop editor. \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nDo proper research on prospectives\r\n‍\r\n\r\nThe more information you have about your prospects, the more you can personalize your outreach. You should look for:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nGeography: Where is your prospect based?\r\nSize of their company and their department?\r\nIndustry: What industry are they?\r\nTechnology: What technology does your prospect use?\r\nRevenue: How much money does the company make yearly?\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of these specific details, you can create tailored content for your initial outreach, which would help you distinguish your personalized email from all the other impersonal ones. In addition, you can streamline the process of finding the information with B2B intelligence tools. For example, Leadfeeder is a great tool that lists companies visiting your website even if they don’t fill out any forms. You can also use hunter.io to find emails of interested people from your niche.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nStick to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)\r\n‍\r\n\r\nAs history says, the best response rate comes from reaching out to the best prospects who are really in need of that product. That is why it’s crucial to maintain your Ideal Customer Profile.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can do this by using filter software that can help you build your ICP. Doing this can help your company increase overall ROI and reduce customer churn.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nAlthough the market updates constantly, using a good B2B intelligence tool can ensure when there are updates in the market, keeping your outreach updated, relevant, and as personalized as possible. Personalization becomes simpler and less time-consuming when the brand is aware of its buyer persona. As a result, emails can be more targeted and have a higher conversion rate. \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nPersonalize based on trigger events\r\n‍\r\n\r\nCertain events can disrupt businesses that you can leverage as an opportunity. Such events are called trigger events.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nIf used timely, these events provide the sales representative to reach out to the prospects with a personalized email around the trigger event.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nHere are a few sample trigger events:\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\n→ New hires at the top of the company.\r\n\r\n→ A significant decision from the competitor.\r\n\r\n→ New round of funding.\r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nThis is an effective strategy because you are reaching out to the prospects when they need your services the most.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‍\r\n\r\nWrapping Up\r\n‍\r\n\r\nYou can build meaningful and unique relationships with your clients and prospects by applying a targeted, segmented, and personalized email marketing strategy. Therefore, they will interact and engage with your brand and content even more. You can explore some of these email personalization practices to enhance your response, click, open, and engagement rates.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore articles\r\nExplore More\r\nBlog post from Copy.ai\r\nThese 29 Content Marketing Examples Got It Right\r\nHow To\r\nJune 17, 2022\r\nBlog post from Copy.ai\r\nHow to Write a Research Proposal That Will Get Approved\r\nHow To\r\nJune 16, 2022\r\nRead', 'blog_06.jpg', '', 'blog', '2022-06-18 14:16:31');
